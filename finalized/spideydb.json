destinations for international students seeking adventure in a bustling metropolis is the centrally located interesting Hong Kong Id like to share with you my observations after four years of studying in Hong Kong and why if youre considering a study abroad adventure in Asia you might want to think about Asias World CityStudy in Hong Kong Where Past and Future CollideHong Kongs strategic location at the center of Asia has allowed it to grow into a globalized city It is known as Asias World City and has developed into the fourthlargest banking and financial hub in the world Eastern and Western cultures have coexisted here creating a vibrant diversity in lifestyle The city is divided between a densely populated mainland and more than 200 offshore islands in the South China Sea with 73 million people making up its ethnically varied worldwide population of natives expatriates and students With its remarkable transport links both within Asia and to the rest of the world Hong Kong has long been a hub for tradeAfter 156 years of British occupation the city returned to Chinese control in 1997 The territory saw enormous historical change during the colonial era and those changes continue to have an impact now Walking across Hong Kong will allow you to see many structures and street names that date back to the colonial era like Gloucester Road and the Former Central Police Station English Common Law is used to govern the city making politics and the legislative process familiar to people who are familiar with British judicial thoughtThe majority of resources in Hong Kong are privately owned and people are free to choose their own means of production and consumption The economy is also very industrialized and it is renowned for its welldeveloped international financial sector minimal taxation and nearly free port trade Hong Kong draws expats and business owners who want to conduct business throughout the rest of Asia and Mainland China because of its advantageous location for expanding businesses A bright future for commerce and economics has promoted not only the exchange of knowledge among firms but also the training of skilled executives and the establishment of the institutions necessary to make this happenThrough the curriculum the British colonial presence has also had an impact on the educational system The Hong Kong educational system altered at the turn of the 20th century to provide topnotch English instruction to better prepare students for further education professional training or additional study abroad With the implementation of new regulations students from all over the city now have access to nighttime sessions in engineering science and business Universities in Hong Kong currently place a great focus on striking a balance between traditional teaching methods and forwardthinking innovations and they push for both strong local commitment and global effectAt the moment Hong Kong provides reputable and wellknown undergraduate and graduate programs in many of the citys universities Hong Kongs educational system has been inspired by the British educational system to give students the knowledge and abilities they need to become tomorrows leadersHow do they compareStudy in Hong Kong versus studying in ChinaIn 1997 China regained control over Hong Kong The framework within which Hong Kong functions as a separate state from the Peoples Republic of China is described by the one country two systems policy PRC In contrast to China Hong Kongs Basic Law upholds British common law and other colonial principles including free speech and property rights Despite having different political systems Hong Kong and Chinas educational systems have developed similarly and undergone similar changesOver the past 200 years higher education has received more attention in both China and Hong Kong The emphasis has been on growing higher education and as this growth has gained steam a variety of nongovernmental projects have also emerged Both Hong Kong and China include private institutions and selffinancing programs that provide a variety of courses to both domestic and foreign students The expansion of the higher education system has also sparked a higher degree of academic interest increasing secondary school enrollment in both locations Given the vast differences in size and number of universities between the two regions the fact that four universities from both regions are included in the Top 10 Universities in Asia for 2018 speaks much about the caliber of education offered in Hong Kong and ChinaUniversities in China and Hong Kong provide courses in numerous languages Mandarin is the official language of China English and Cantonese a variant of southern Chinese are the official languages of Hong Kong You might wish to look into which colleges provide English as the language of teaching if youre an international student coming without any prior knowledge of Asian languages Although Englishspeaking students may find a list of modules geared for learning Mandarin at their host university most higher education institutions in China concentrate on teaching lessons in Mandarin While study in Hong Kong youll observe that English is the language of instructionIn contrast students and the general public in Hong Kong have unrestricted access to the Internet and social media however they might use Chinesespecific social media programs if they need to conduct business or communicate with friends in Mainland ChinaWhat are the advantages of study in Hong

discoveries of Prof Long Quan\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating the world around us used to entail paper charts and maps and the skill to interpret the system of signs and symbols that stood in for the real objects and features of the landscape Not any more with the arrival of 3D mapping that visualizes the realworld route to your destination\n\u00a0\nBehind the opening salvos of simplifying travel for you and me lies an array of complex and lengthy research carried out over the past 30 years It has taken this time and some of the worlds leading minds in computer vision to make such a development possible Beyond a host of significant uses now beckon\n\u00a0\nAmong the global pioneers is Prof Long Quan Computer Science and Engineering who has devoted his entire academic career to the advancement of computer vision and 3D reconstruction from images through his own innovative contributions to these scientific areas and the mentoring of nextgeneration research stars\n\u00a0\nThis is the future said Prof Quan Founding Director of the HKUST Center for Visual Computing and Image Science Your mobile phone will show you 3D images and it will be very convenient for moving around Think of all the other uses for such maps too Search and rescue teams would know the exact terrain they faced before they set out The military could use 3D maps to guide missiles\n\u00a0\nWhen I started this was a relatively new field But we already saw the potential for applications\n\u00a0\nFor Prof Quan once a child artist who swapped paint brushes for computer vision visual images are a fundamental element of life that speak to us directly He has lived in this world of 3D reconstruction from the time of his graduate studies in France in the mid1980s which began with his Masters at Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9 and was followed by a doctorate at the Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine INPL now both part of the University of Lorraine The two institutions were leading establishments with laboratories affiliated with CNRS the French National Center for Scientific Research and INRIA the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation Prof Quan was a member of one of the earliest cohorts of Mainland students to receive a scholarship from the Ministry of Education to study overseas following his graduation from Northern Jiaotong University now Beijing Jiaotong University in 1984\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter earning his PhD in 1989 Prof Quan launched his academic career at INRIA Grenoble Frances key public research institute focused on computational sciences and contributed significantly to the development of modern 3D computer vision in the 1990s through his outstanding series of 3D reconstruction algorithms including the sixpoint algorithm and projective reconstruction from multiple views He joined HKUST in 2001 where he remains fascinated by the potential of the area and expects to stay so in the decades ahead\n\u00a0\nRecent advances include reconstruction algorithms and systems developed together with his research team to address the challenge of missing detail that arises with present mapping technology Current techniques use unmanned aerial vehicles and groundlevel cars to collect image data with areas that escape attention needing to be filled in manually Through Prof Quans breakthrough manual inputting can be replaced by automated reconstruction of buildings and landmarks based on the images collected This can take the technology to fresh heights of accuracy\n\u00a0\nUnsurprisingly Prof Quans work has attracted attention from other academics and a wide range of companies including Google Nokia Microsoft Airbus Thales and Mainland China industries He has over 6700 citations and an Hindex a recognized measure of productivity and citation impact of 43 according to Google Scholar In addition he has served as an editor and chair in all major computer vision journals and conferences respectively and in 2011 was a General Chair of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision the premier biennial event in this field globally \u201cI have been very fortunate to be able to contribute to computer vision and serve this young and dynamic community he said\n\u00a0\nProf Quan believes his ongoing enthusiasm is driven by intellectual curiosity and a desire to see the knowledge he uncovers put to use Along with applications such uses encompass teaching and sharing his expertise and passion for discovery with students He is a devoted educator and has twice been elected a HKUST Best Ten Lecturer in an independent studentorganized poll He is also a dedicated supervisor of graduate students including Peter Sturm the first awardee of the Best French PhD Dissertation of the Year in Computer Science Le Prix de Th\u00e8se SPECIF 1998 now known as Le Prix de Th\u00e8se Gilles Kahn and Maxime Lhuillier who received the ICPR Piero Zamperoni Best Student Paper Award in 2000 His graduate students now hold faculty positions in worldrenowned institutions and universities such as CNRS INRIA Peking University National University of Singapore and Princeton University\n\u00a0\nProf Quan is now driving advances through the further development of algorithms and systems for 3D mapping Such work has attracted a constant stream of sixfigure funding under various Hong Kong Research Grants Council schemes and from industry grants Several patents have been awarded and others are pending In addition a related HKUST startup has been launched The search is continuous for ways to advance through greater accuracy higher resolution and faster speed he noted\n\u00a0\nOne key project is to map the whole of Hong Kong in 3D This is our dream Prof Quan said We have started to undertake the work However data capture is expensive I am now applying for funding through different channels to enable us to reach our goal Such a survey would assist various industries including logistics and navigation companies Urban planners could also benefit\n\u00a0\nComputer vision is different from other computer science areas as you see concrete objects not only abstract numbers Prof Quan said To me the fascination of the 3D shape is endless Its construction which involves both visual artistic form and geometry is of constant interest We still have a great deal to explore in terms of applications but we are moving forward\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA Visionary Career\n\n\n\nProf Long Quans pathway to pioneering insights\n\n\n\n\nBS

Graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Banner\n\n\n\nProf Pedro Sander from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering has recently been focusing on gigantic panorama videos such as this still of a zoomedin area of Central taken from The Peak in Hong Kong\u00a0Download Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody\nFrom working with renowned talent from around the world and participating in exciting computer graphics projects to coming up with new research ideas through teaching Professor Pedro SANDER has had an invigorating journey at the HKUST Department of Computer Science and Engineering so far\nIt\u2019s a long way from Brazil to Hong Kong but Prof Pedro Sander says he sees many similarities between the city he now lives in and the town near Rio de Janeiro where he grew up \u201cHong Kong actually reminds me of Rio \u2013 the natural beauty in a big city the skyscrapers and the sea remind me of home\u201d he muses \u201cHong Kong is very international a melting pot of people from all over the world\u201d\nProf Sander also experiences this cosmopolitanism at HKUST which he joined in 2006 having earned a Master\u2019s and a PhD from Harvard University followed by a stint as a senior member of the Application Research Group of ATI Research in Marlborough Massachusetts\n\u201cWhen I first came to Hong Kong I didn\u2019t expect to be here this long\u201d he says \u201cI find the city extremely organized it\u2019s easy to get things done HKUST has an impressive community with advanced research areas and extremely bright students from Hong Kong and abroad That combination of the strength of the university and the appeal of the city make it very attractive to academics and overseas students\u201d\nBreakthrough in Graphics\nAt the School of Engineering Prof Sander has been involved in a number of promising research projects in the field of computer graphics Most recently he was part of a team of researchers using looping video content to form a gigantic panorama \nPanorama images are created by stitching together multiple highresolution photographs While putting together a panorama with video content is more challenging the technology can be used in a wide range of areas from virtual tours in the travel industry to surveillance in the security sector\n\u201cIt was research from the ground up as there were no methods for creating a video panorama of this scale using raw video content\u201d Prof Sander explains \u201cSome interesting projects in the past have taken smaller datasets and looped them together The task we set ourselves was to do this on a massive scale\u201d\nThey ended up fixing a professional 4K video camera onto a robotic arm to capture spatially overlapping eightsecond videos which were then processed to stabilize the content and ensure consistency in brightness and color The team devised an optimization method to stitch the videos together into a gigantic highresolution panorama They also developed an interface to enable authors and viewers to edit specific areas of the video\nIn the next phase of the project the team is considering the use of drones to capture the videos which involves challenges in camera stabilization \u201cAnother potential project is to try to embed smaller videos into different parts of the panorama adding sound and other interactive elements or even realtime dynamic content so people can zoom into the image and interact with it\u201d Prof Sander says\nTeaching Inspires Research\nThe COVID19 pandemic offered him an opportunity to combine his love of the visual with a burning global issue in the classroom \u201cIn devising our programming assignments we try to think of current events and problems that may interest students to link classroom learning with the wider world\u201d he shares \nThus for the introductory C programming course he coteaches with Dr Cecia Chan and Dr Cindy Li they worked with teaching associate Mr Wallace Mak to develop programming assignments asking students to process the COVID19 case data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University \n\u201cThe idea was to explore the wealth of available data to generate some statistics that allow students to analyze the current outbreak situation in different countries\u201d he says Prof Sander then developed a webbased motion chart that loads and displays the statistics from student assignments to help them visualize trends and went on to come up with a more advanced version of the visualization tool online \u201cIt became a hit online with several people using it daily to explore the statistics and better analyze the current situation in several countries\u201d he says \nThis project inspired a further investigation into how to assign optimal mostly unique colors to countries in the visualization \u201cI am now collaborating with Prof Guilherme FONSECA\u00a0from AixMarseille University who is developing an algorithm to automatically assign color visualization based on the national colors of each country We plan to further explore other aspects of the visualization as well\u201d The project is an encouraging example of how research can not only inspire teaching but how the classroom can spark new research ideas as well \nWhat is his pedagogical philosophy \u201cWhat I cherish most in academia is the opportunity to enable possibilities where students work on projects that they are passionate about and they move on with their careers and do very well in their chosen fields\u201d he shares \u201cThis process of watching students from the beginning of their trajectory all the way to fulfilling their career dreams is what\u2019s most satisfying\u201d \nAttracting the Best\nWith the recent rise in big data and artificial intelligence admission into the department is no easy feat \u201cWhat is exciting about our students at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level is how motivated they are\u201d he observes \nFaculty members of HKUST Computer Science and Engineering are renowned in a broad range of fields covering almost every area of computing Irrespective of their area of interest students can find advisors in their research field in the department \nApart from the HKUST community what kept Prof Sander in Hong Kong and HKUST for more than 14 years Prof Sander is a foodie who enjoys exploring the cuisines of the world available in Hong Kong and participating in various sports on campus \u201cThese were a lot of fun and led to many friendships with alumni in Hong Kong I particularly enjoy the many tennis events we organized with the student team\u201d He is eagerly awaiting the opening of the new HKUST Water Sports Centre where students alumni and staff will be able to try dragon boating windsurfing and other water sports \nHe strongly believes that as a relatively young university HKUST is well positioned to attract and integrate people from all over the world \u201cWe have faculty and students from everywhere This has encouraged me to stay on for so long even though Hong Kong is so far away from Brazil\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Tags\n\n\nNews

Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody\nProf CHEN Kai Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering CSE excels in building big projects from scratch Born and bred in rural China he is now the brain behind what will become Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018brain\u2019 in future \u2013 the nextgeneration artificial intelligence AI computing hub for the entire city that encompasses smart bus schedules taxi dispatch typhoon warning medical diagnoses fintech and others As the key scientist collaborating with the government to set up the IT infrastructure for Hong Kong\u2019s smart city development the professor is setting a new paradigm for the decades to come \nSetting new paradigm for Hong Kong\u2019s AI hub\nHong Kong\u2019s Smart City Blueprint announced by the government in 2017 aims at using innovation and technology to address urban challenges enhance effectiveness and improve quality of living and sustainability It covers smart mobility smart living smart environment smart people smart government and smart economy \nAwarded Research Grants Council\u2019s Themebased Research Scheme funding in July this year Prof Chen is working with the government to build the infrastructural core of the city\u2019s AI hub Leveraging on his highperformance distributed machine learning framework for graphbased streaming data with smart city applications Prof Chen will lead his research lab intelligent System Networking iSING to conduct research on the nextgeneration AI computing hub The hub will enable researchers and practitioners to participate in data collaboration through a highperformance privacypreserving computing platform that will drive Hong Kong\u2019s smart city applications\nHis brainchild the nextgeneration AI computing hub for smarter Hong Kong boasts the benefits of having high performance and privacy preservation \u201cFirstly there is high performance as we can handle big data within short time frames often reducing work duration from weeks to days or even hours for certain processes This is done by training up our models with data analytics and machine learning Secondly there is privacy preservation as we use encryption to enable technologies that can learn from data and do so without disclosing identities in relation to the data\u201d\nTake hospital data for instance Whereas individual hospitals need to protect data of their own patients there is need for the medical community to combine data from different hospitals to enlarge the sample size for research To address hospitals\u2019 concerns Prof Chen and his team deploy advanced encryption technologies such that data can be combined to establish machine learning models for collective learning and disease diagnoses Most importantly the encrypted data somehow never leave individual hospitals This is a milestone in privacy preservation The same principle applies to financial services across banks\nHis AIenabled smart city infrastructure and applications with millions of nodes to represent different entities and locations including buildings and road intersections in continuous data streams have the advantage of enhancing efficiency and convenience Currently working with the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Observatory Prof Chen\u2019s team has collected massive spatialtemporal graphbased city data in various aspects These data can be leveraged by deep neural networks such as graph convolutional networks to build powerful models for different smart applications Planning to apply their machine learning methodology to optimize the Hong Kong transportation system the team\u2019s research can be applied to the reduction of waiting time and traffic jam by smart bus scheduling flexible rearrangement of directions regarding traffic lanes during rush hour as well as prediction of passenger hot spots for taxi dispatch \nWith the government grant Prof Chen will continue to build the mega AI system with data center and cloud computing capacities to drive transportation optimization healthcare fintech and other areas for the entire Hong Kong Prior to this he had been building the system in his lab with his students and had generated impact in Google Nvidia Huawei etc with their designs adopted \u201cI have been building the system since as early as 2012 when I joined HKUST and it involves timeconsuming research on hardware software design theories and implementation We now anticipate that this AI computing platform system will be open to HKUST faculty by 2021 and to all local universities by 2022 It will ultimately be adopted by the whole city\u201d\nPioneer in AI\nAs a young professor barely in his late 30s how did Prof Chen rise to the important position he is assuming now \nBorn and bred in a small village with only seven families in Anhui province in Mainland China he had learned to be persistent and resilient since a young age \u201cFrom my village I had to walk 10km or two hours every day across a small mountain to go to school in town and return home My family used to raise goats for meat to be sold in the market and I played with the goats after school My dad was a teacher I was aware of my sensitivity to numbers when I was young For example I can remember the 11digit phone numbers by just looking at them once\u201d\nWhen he was a teenager in the 1990s his parents took him for a short trip to Shanghai The experience of going to a big city for the first time became a memorable episode in his life and sowed the seeds for studying abroad later \u201cGrowing up in a rural village surrounded by big mountains I was extremely excited and impressed when I saw the contrasting scene in the modern city full of skyscrapers and people I learned that the world is colourful and it inspired me to go out and explore when I grew up\u201d\nAlways coming first in class the hardworking and outstanding student later became one of the only two in his junior middle school to be promoted to a prestigious senior high school in his province He then went on to the University of Science and Technology of China in Anhui\u2019s capital Hefei for bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree studies in computer science \u201cAt that time computer science was becoming popular and I foresaw that it would be very useful Also my interest in math and sensitivity to numbers provided a solid foundation for my studies\u201d\nHe attained his goal of seeing the world when he pursued doctoral studies also in computer science at Northwestern University in Chicago US between 2007 and 2012 In late 2008 he read one of the first papers about data center and cloud computing just as the emerging field was beginning to become popular \u201cI was very interested and I knew it would become huge and influential\u201d he said He has been pursuing this topic ever since No wonder he refers to his time at Northwestern as an experience that changed him a lot \nIn August 2009 one month after his first child was born he went from Chicago to Beijing\u2019s Microsoft Research Lab for a threemonth internship Feeling most inspired and returning to the US in the Fall he was so fascinated that he worked for several months nonstop even during Christmas and New Year when there was no one else in the university\u2019s computer laboratory to write a paper on data center His efforts paid off and the paper was accepted by the flagship conference in the field ACM SIGCOMM as a Best Paper Candidate in August 2010 when he was still a PhD student The achievement of publishing his paper in an international conference known for its extremely low acceptance rate marked a turning point in his life\n\u201cMy wife was very supportive she sacrificed a lot to make that happen\u201d he said Today he talks about his three children aged 11 eight and one with a big happy smile He has also continued to contribute to the conference with the first two homegrown papers from Hong Kong in ACM SIGCOMM 2016 He explained the challenge behind his research \u201cUnlike theory research research on data center and cloud computing requires a lot of time to build a real system using many computers So it could take two to three years to build one system for one paper\u201d To learn about the hard work behind read the article on the CSE Department\u2019s WeChat public account\nAs one of the few who started working on data center and cloud computing back in 2008 and who continues to work on cuttingedge research he is now the Executive VicePresident of the Hong Kong Society of Artificial Intelligence  Robotics HKSAIR With Hong Kong\u2019s AI and robotics research quickly developing and receiving lots of government attention he hopes to accelerate the process by contributing to highperformance AI infrastructure that lays the foundation for faster applications algorithms and models\nSetting goals\nThe professor finds HKUST a quiet and peaceful place for research which is also conveniently located near urban hubs \u201cAs the best university in Asia HKUST has one of the top computer science and engineering departments and engineering schools I enjoy the mix of Asian and Western cultures the academic and research environment as well as the beautiful campus here I can easily visit my parents in my hometown in China\u201d\nBeing diligent and targetoriented Prof Chen encourages young people to set goals \u201cFalling in love with and pursuing data center and cloud computing research since 2008 I can tell from my personal experience that one has to follow one\u2019s passion It is important to set goals at different stages and work towards them Work hard and never give up\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Tags\n\n\nNews Tags\n\nSmart Cities\nComputer Science

medicine\n\nBy Sylvia Chang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday November 02 2018 1033\nBy Sylvia Chang\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine has been dismissed as nonsense for decades by many and its case hasn\u2019t been helped by a lack of success in proving its efficacy scientifically Sylvia Chang explains how artificial intelligence may provide that proof\u2018Be water my friend\u201d said kung fu icon Bruce Lee an expression of what often seems contradictory in the philosophies of Chinese culture and tradition Kung fu also sets out to harness Qi the energy that flows through the body These are concepts inherent in the practice of traditional Chinese medicine TCMTCM has struggled for \u201crespectability\u201d Some dismiss it as a collection of old wives tales practiced by \u201ca bunch of hippies\u201d without sufficient medical training to know what they\u2019re doingThe symptom cooccurrence patterns detected from data are used to establish rules for patient classification\u00a0Nevin Zhang Lianwen professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science of TechnologyThese days however artificial intelligence is being applied to TCM adding to the decades of laboratory research that had only limited success in validating the practice For many people when thinking of AI they conjure pictures of autonomous cars working without human beings or robots running around and chatting with people But outside the mainstream AI is also applied in TCM The debate rages on as it has done for more than half a century\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for all these years in Chinese medicine but we never used the term precision medicine Now we can\u201d said Vivian Taam Wong honorary professor in the School of Chinese Medicine at the University of Hong Kong By precision medicine she refers to the customization of healthcare with medical treatments and practices tailored for individual patients As people have different responses to a disease due to the divergence in body constitution and environments this model allows the optimal therapies to be selected based on a patient\u2019s genetic content\u00a0AI technologies have been used to explain how TCM works both in philosophy and practice A case in point is in the treatment of functional dyspepsia patients In the next one or two years functional dyspepsia patients in Hong Kong which account for 8 percent of the population will be supported by TCM treatments with statistically precise methods\u00a0\u201cThere is an urgent need of using novel methods for exploring the traditional wisdom of Chinese medicine diagnostic processes such that treatment could be tailored for each patient with even greater precision\u201d said Vincent Chung Chiho associate professor in the School of Chinese Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong In January Chung will launch a study on datadriven identification and classification of Chinese medicine syndromes among functional dyspepsia patients with the application of AI technologies\u00a0Nevin Zhang Lianwen professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science of Technology PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILYMore than lab testsWestern medicine involves lab tests to assist in diagnosis TCM is much more \u201cinvolved\u201d making overall observations about symptoms based on four different approaches They include inspection of a patient\u2019s physical condition hearing to find the abnormal sound of speech respiration and cough and smelling of the patient\u2019s body and excreta inquiry into the development treatment present symptoms and other information of the disease and palpation of the pulse\u00a0There is an urgent need of using novel methods for exploring the traditional wisdom of Chinese medicine diagnostic processesVincent Chung Chiho associate professor in the School of Chinese Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong KongTCM diagnostic theories involve a large number of \u201clatent symptoms\u201d For example when experiencing the kidney yang deficiency syndrome the patient will present a wide constellation of symptoms that manifest the syndrome These symptoms may include obvious complaints that can be easily detected by TCM clinicians However many are subtler which will require detailed analysis on their relative importance in ruling in or out a particular syndrome diagnosis The relative contribution of these symptoms to a specific syndrome is difficult to observe directly That\u2019s why a patient might get different diagnoses from two practitioners due to discrepancies in their experience and trainingBased on TCM physicians\u2019 diagnosis a patient would be given herbal medicine or acupuncture These syndrome types as described in TCM such as yang deficiency signs include cold limbs weak breathing or profuse sweating and yin deficiency signs include night sweats dry mouth muscle aches or anxiety have never been verified scientifically and critics often dismiss them as practitioners\u2019 subjective notionsVincent Chung Chiho associate professor in the School of Chinese Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILYNevin Zhang Lianwen professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science of Technology uses what he terms \u201clatent tree analysis\u201d to answer critics and skeptics who regard TCM syndromes as pure subjective fabricationsZhang applied AI technologies to TCM soon after the millennium With latent tree analysis he aims to \u201cidentify symptom cooccurrence patterns in medical survey data cluster patients based on the patterns and use the patients\u2019 clusters as a basis to establish TCM diagnosis guidelines\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe symptom cooccurrence patterns detected from data are used to establish rules for patient classification Clinic diagnosis consistence would be improved if doctors use the rules as reference\u201d Zhang said adding that AI technologies have an important role to play in the modernization of TCMTraditional Chinese medicine is much more \u201cinvolved\u201d than Western medicine making overall observations about symptoms based on four different approaches Palpating the pulse is one of them EDMOND TANG  CHINA DAILYLatent symptomsPatients with functional dyspepsia have a chronic disorder of movement at the upper digestive tract Usually a patient who feels discomfort after a meal or epigastric pain without bacterial infection will be suggested to receive an endoscopy check of the upper digestive tract If no structural problems like ulcer are observed the patient may be diagnosed as having functional dyspepsiaWe\u2019ve been doing this for all these years in Chinese medicine but we\u2019ve never used the term precision medicine Now we canVivian Taam Wong honorary professor in the School of Chinese Medicine at the University of Hong KongChung said some of the functional dyspepsia patients may not respond to conventional medications Instead Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture have proved to be effective However since the TCM syndromes of each functional dyspepsia patient may vary there is a need to map out a TCM diagnostic algorithm so that clinicians would be equipped with an evidencebased tool for individualizing treatment\u201cThe individualized approach in TCM requires tailoring of treatment in accordance to varying TCM syndromes If we can understand the diagnostic algorithm of different syndromes and harmonize how to diagnose them with higher accuracy we will then be better equipped with tools for achieving greater diagnostic precision for each patient\u201d said Chung who is using Zhang\u2019s latent tree analysis to do the study\u00a0The first step Chung said is to collect highquality data on patients\u2019 symptoms He will \u201ccreate detailed case report forms based on best available evidence on the four diagnostics practices in TCM\u201d After data collection Chung sends it to Zhang for analysis Through latent tree analysis an accurate diagnosis can be createdIn the book Living Standards Analytics Development through the Lens of Household Survey Data the authors reviewed Zhang\u2019s model They write \u201cThe results tend to confirm known theories in Chinese traditional medicine This is a significant advance since the scientific bases for these theories are not known The model proposed by the authors provides at least a statistical justification for them\u201dThe application of AI in TCM has received favorable comments in the TCM research community An emerging group of scholars have succeeded in earning research grants with latent tree analysisVivian Taam Wong honorary professor in the School of Chinese Medicine at the University of Hong Kong PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILYWong of HKU said AI technologies in addition to helping in TCM diagnosis and treatment also support the discovery of new drugs\u201cThe use of big data would help in identifying the effective compound in Chinese herbs It would find out where the compound works when it works and the core compounds for effective treatment\u201d said Wong who is also former president of the Hong Kong Association for Integration of ChineseWestern MedicineThe Hong Kong government attached great importance to TCM In the 201819 Budget a HK500million fund was established to promote the development of Chinese medicine Meanwhile the government has preserved land in Tseung Kwan O to build the firstever Chinese medicine hospital Wong expected more funds to be invested in the research of TCM with biotechnology \u201cWhen more money comes in to support new technologies Chinese medicine will see great improvement in pharmaceutics and diagnosis\u201d she said\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nHong Kongs exports value down 88 in Feb\n\n\n\n2\n\nChinas

Cases and Shows Proximity Risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Banner\n\n\n\nProf Gary Chan center from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and his research team \u00a0Download Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology HKUST has launched CovidInArea information accessible through the project page\u00a0httpsproximityriskhkgithubio a privacypreserving mobilefriendly app which integrates and visualizes the open data \u201cList of buildings visited by cases tested positive for SARSCoV2 virus in the past 14 days\u201d hereinafter referred as \u201cincident places\u201d from the Department of Health DoH of HKSAR Government as an easily accessible heat map providing a free locationbased tool for users to understand their risk due to proximity with the incident places\u00a0\nUsing big data mining and machine learning techniques a team led by Prof Gary CHAN ShuengHan Department of Computer Science and Engineering has designed and developed the app which consists of a realtime heat map for browsing the locations of the incident places at a quick glance Unlike other existing platforms and apps which mostly require users to check the locations manually CovidInArea runs the check automatically by providing realtime GPS support for mobile users It is the first public COVID19 related app available in both Google Play Store and Apple App Store developed by a university for citywide use anywhere in Hong Kong\u00a0\nThe heat map pinpoints incident places given by DoH based on data updated continuously according to government\u2019s daily release By zooming in and out on the heat map users can immediately gain a complete picture of the incident places which are indicated by hues of different temperature hence able to make informed decisions in their daily routine path planning and keep safe distancing\nUser privacy is ensured in CovidInArea which requires no user registration and collects no personal information beyond GPS location All computations are carried out with results presented locally on one\u2019s phone while the GPS location once consumed is immediately discarded without storage at any time\nMore importantly with GPS on users can easily visualize in a chart \u2013 over a period of several days \u2013 the number of incident places in their proximity in real time Taking into consideration the distance users\u2019 dwell time number of the incident places in proximity the app also indicates the overall proximity risk using a color radar chart\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Red\u00a0Overall high sustained contact with incident places Recommended to reduce highrisk places manage health and take voluntary testing if needed\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Yellow\u00a0Medium risk Be cautious Plan safe paths to reduce risk\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Green\u00a0Low risk Stay vigilant\nProf Gary Chan said \u201cAs the number of confirmed cases in Hong Kong has remained high recently the app provides a timely and userfriendly reference on incident places to help citizens stay vigilant to their surroundings and take precautions if necessary to proactively reduce the infection risk while commuting With CovidInArea users may take appropriate actions to plan daily routes manage their health and keep safe distancing from the incident places We thank the government for opening up the data for public use to fight against COVID19 together\u201d\nProf Gary Chan is an expert in developing novel and precise sensing and positioning technologies for smart applications He worked with the government to develop a geofencing technology applied in StayHomeSafe app to enforce local home quarantine order He has also innovated a privacypreserving mobile app that senses registered Bluetooth signals to efficiently search for missing dementia patients in the city His indoor navigation technology has also been deployed in many malls and venues\nCovidInArea is currently available in Google Play Store and Apple App Store in Hong Kong For app installation one may use hisher phone to visit this\u00a0link or scan the following QR code\n\nThis news was originally published by the HKUST Public Affairs Office\u00a0here\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Tags\n\n\nNews Tags\n\nComputer Science and

incident places with hues of different temperature The warmer the color red and orange the higher the density of incident places \n\n\n\n\n\nThe user could know the exact locations of the incident places by zooming in the heat map \n\n\n\n\n\nThe app also indicates the overall proximity risk taking into consideration the distance between the user and the incident places users\u2019 dwell time and the number of incident places in proximity with a color radar chart \u2013 Red High risk Yellow Medium risk Green Low risk\n\n\n\n\n\nProf Gary Chan center from the Department of Computer Science

introduce traditional noncloud parallel and distributed database systems Concepts like SQL and NoSQL systems data replication distributed and parallel query processing and data recovery after different types of failures will be covered Then I will discuss how the emergence of the public cloud has introduced new requirements on parallel and distributed database systems and how such requirements have necessitated fundamental changes to the architectures of such systems I will illustrate the related developments by discussing some of the details of systems like Alibaba POLARDB Microsoft Azure SQL DB Microsoft Socrates Azure Synapse POLARIS Google Spanner Google F1 CockroachDB Amazon Aurora Snowflake and Google AlloyDB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Format\n\nSeminar Lecture
